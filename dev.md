**You:** There is a long-running stigma associated with developing desktop apps using Electron. So, to avoid that, I decided to build with Tauri written in Rust, which has relatively lower memory consumption issues. But the problem is, I am a new Rust programmer. I can write a few functions, but I am not anywhere close to an intermediate Rust dev. So, could you give me your advice on what to do as a solo dev trying to build and release a product like this? Note: Tauri has a feature called Sidecar that allows us to embed Node.js executable binaries.

**Me:** It sounds like you're in a challenging yet exciting position as a solo developer working with Tauri and Rust. Here are some tips to help you navigate through this process:

1. **Leverage Tauri's Features**: Since Tauri offers the Sidecar feature to embed Node.js executable binaries, make sure to leverage this effectively. It allows you to use Node.js libraries and functionality within your Rust application, which can be incredibly useful for tasks like handling file systems, networking, or interfacing with other services.

2. **Learning Rust**: Since you're relatively new to Rust, dedicate some time to learning the language. There are plenty of online resources available, including the official Rust documentation, Rust programming books, and community tutorials. Start with small projects and gradually work your way up to more complex ones. Don't hesitate to ask questions on forums or seek help from more experienced Rust developers.

3. **Incremental Development**: Break down your project into smaller, manageable tasks and focus on implementing them incrementally. This approach will help you stay organized and make steady progress while learning Rust and developing your application.

4. **Community Support**: Take advantage of the Tauri community for support and guidance. Join their official Discord server or other relevant forums where you can interact with other developers using Tauri. You can ask questions, share experiences, and learn from each other's challenges and successes.

5. **Testing and Debugging**: Writing tests for your code and debugging issues as they arise are crucial steps in the development process. Familiarize yourself with Rust's testing framework and debugging tools to ensure the reliability and stability of your application.

6. **Documentation**: Document your code, APIs, and project setup thoroughly. This will not only help you understand your own codebase better but also make it easier for others to contribute to your project or for future maintenance tasks.

7. **Stay Updated**: Keep an eye on updates and releases from the Tauri project and the Rust ecosystem in general. New features, bug fixes, and performance improvements could benefit your project and save you time and effort in the long run.

8. **Seek Feedback**: Don't hesitate to seek feedback from users, peers, or mentors as you progress with your project. Constructive feedback can help you identify areas for improvement and refine your application's features and usability.

9. **Patience and Persistence**: Building a desktop application from scratch, especially as a solo developer, can be challenging and time-consuming. Be patient with yourself, celebrate your progress, and persist through difficulties. Every obstacle you overcome brings you one step closer to your goal.

By following these tips and staying dedicated to your project, you'll gradually become more proficient in Rust and successfully build and release your desktop application with Tauri. Good luck!

**You:** Thanks for the message above. My other question is, should I create the features that I am unable to replicate in Rust for now using the Sidecar feature, so that in due time, after I have gotten skilled enough in Rust, I will start rewriting those logic in Rust?

**Me:** Yes, that's a valid approach. Leveraging the Sidecar feature in Tauri to incorporate functionality that you're not yet comfortable implementing in Rust is a pragmatic strategy. It allows you to move forward with your project while gradually improving your Rust skills.

By using Node.js via the Sidecar feature for certain parts of your application, you can focus on developing the core features of your desktop app in Rust, where its performance benefits are most valuable. Meanwhile, you can defer implementing more complex or unfamiliar logic in Rust until you feel confident in your ability to do so effectively.

As you become more proficient in Rust, you can gradually refactor and rewrite the Node.js-dependent parts of your application in Rust, taking advantage of its performance, safety, and concurrency features. This iterative process allows you to improve the codebase over time while ensuring that you maintain forward momentum in your development efforts.

Just be mindful of the trade-offs involved in using a mixed-language approach, such as potential overhead from interop between Rust and Node.js, and ensure that it aligns with your project's goals and constraints. Overall, it's a pragmatic strategy for solo developers looking to balance learning new skills with delivering a functional product.
